ii.	1970s - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The development of OOP languages like Smalltalk revolutionized software development by promoting reusability and modularity.
iii.	1990s - Agile Methodologies: The introduction of Agile methodologies like Scrum and Extreme Programming aimed at adapting to rapid changes and improving software quality.

3.	List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i.	Requirement Analysis: Gathering and defining what the system needs to do.
ii.	Design: Planning the system architecture and components.
iii.	Implementation: Coding the software.
iv.	Testing: Ensuring the software works correctly.
v.	Maintenance: Updating and fixing the software post-deployment.
4.	Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
A linear sequential model that works effectively for projects with clear needs is called waterfall. It moves through the phases in a single direction.
Agile allows for flexibility and ongoing improvement because it is gradual and iterative. For projects where requirements are anticipated to change regularly, it is perfect.

5.	Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a.	Software developers write code, fix issues, and keep the program up to date.
b.	Software is tested by a quality assurance engineer to guarantee its functioning and quality.
c.	Project Manager: Supervises the project, keeps track of deadlines, and organizes teamwork.

6.	Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i.	Integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Visual Studio and Eclipse, provides tools for testing, debugging, and coding that increase productivity.
ii.	VCS - e.g., Git, SVN - Version Control Systems manage changes to source code, facilitating collaboration and tracking modifications.

7.	What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i.	Complexity
Explanation: Modern software systems often involve numerous components, technologies, and dependencies, making the architecture and design highly complex. Engineers need to manage a variety of aspects, from performance optimization to security, all while ensuring the system is maintainable.
Strategy to Overcome: Break down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules using Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban. This allows for incremental progress, where each component is developed and tested independently, reducing the overall complexity. Additionally, using design patterns and modular coding helps create reusable components that simplify future development.
ii.	Changing Requirements
Explanation: Requirements for a software project often change during development, driven by evolving customer needs, market trends, or business goals. This can lead to a need for frequent adjustments, causing disruptions to timelines and resource allocation.
Strategy to Overcome: The use of Agile methodologies allows for flexibility and adaptability. In Agile, projects are developed in short sprints, which means teams can quickly adjust to new requirements without derailing the entire project. Regular meetings and feedback loops with stakeholders ensure that changes are implemented early before they become more costly.
iii.	Tight Deadlines
Explanation: Software engineers often face pressure to deliver projects within tight timelines, which can lead to rushed development, technical debt, and lower quality code.
Strategy to Overcome: Implementing continuous integration (CI) practices helps maintain a steady workflow, ensuring that code is integrated, tested, and deployed frequently. This avoids the last-minute rush and identifies issues early in the process. Additionally, thorough documentation and automated testing can save time by minimizing the need for manual fixes and rework.
8.	Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i.	Unit Testing
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of the software to ensure that each one functions as expected. These components are the smallest testable parts of an application, such as functions or methods. The goal of unit testing is to verify the correctness of isolated code blocks, ensuring they behave as intended independently from the rest of the system. It is performed by developers during the development phase. An example includes testing a function that calculates the total of an order to ensure it correctly handles different inputs like discounts, taxes, and quantities.
ii.	Integration Testing
Integration testing checks how different modules or components interact with each other after being integrated. It ensures that individual units, when combined, work together as expected.  The purpose of this type of testing is to identify issues that may arise when modules are integrated, such as data flow errors, communication mismatches, or interface problems. It is done after unit testing, but before system testing, when multiple modules are combined. An example of this type of testing includes testing how a payment gateway module interacts with an order processing module to ensure data is transmitted correctly between them.
iii.	System Testing
System testing involves testing the complete and fully integrated software system to verify that it meets all specified requirements. It checks the end-to-end functionality of the software, including all its components and external interfaces. The goal of system testing is to ensure that the entire application functions correctly as a whole and that all components are working together smoothly. It is performed after integration testing and before acceptance testing. An example of system testing includes an e-commerce website from browsing products, adding them to the cart, making payments, and checking the confirmation of an order to ensure the entire workflow operates as expected.
iv.	Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing, performed to determine if the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the customer. It evaluates whether the system satisfies the end-user needs and expectations. The objective of acceptance testing is to validate that the system does what the business requires and ensure itâ€™s ready for deployment. It is done after system testing and before the product is handed over to the customer. Example of acceptance testing includes a healthcare application with real-world scenarios provided by stakeholders to ensure it meets their needs, such as patient record management and appointment scheduling.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1.	Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves designing inputs (prompts) for AI models to generate specific, desired outputs. 
It is essential for optimizing interactions with AI, ensuring precision and clarity in the responses.

2.	Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague: "Tell me Software Engineering and its Future."
Improved: "explain the Future of Software Engineering in Relation to the ever-changing Environment."
Explanation: The improved prompt is more effective as it specifies the type of information required, making the response more targeted and useful.  The prompt is more specific since as technology continues to evolve rapidly, software engineering must adapt to an ever-changing environment driven by new demands, emerging technologies, and global challenges
